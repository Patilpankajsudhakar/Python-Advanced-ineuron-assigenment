    "Answer: A regular expression is a special sequence of characters that helps us to match or find other strings or sets of strings, using a specialized syntax held in a pattern. Regular expressions are widely used in UNIX world. The Python module re provides full support for Perl-like regular expressions in Python. The re module raises the exception re.error if an error occurs while compiling or using a regular expression."

(ab)c+ will match ‘ab’ followed by any non-zero number of ‘c’s; it will not match just ‘ab’. similarly for a(bc)+ it will match ‘a’ followed by any non-zero number of ‘bc’s; it will not match just ‘a’."
