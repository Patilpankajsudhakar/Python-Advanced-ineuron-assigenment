    "Answer: An advantage of reverse Polish notation is that it removes the need for parentheses that are required by infix notation. While 3 − 4 × 5 can also be written 3 − (4 × 5), that means something quite different from (3 − 4) × 5. A program counter is also known as an instruction counter, instruction pointer, instruction address register or sequence control register. It is a digital counter needed for faster execution of tasks as well as for tracking the current execution point"
